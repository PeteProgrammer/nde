# NDE

Attempt to create better build tools for .NET applications, not depending on
Visual Studio, nor the typical project/solution files generated by VS (or
Xamarin)

Though some tooling exist to allow you to code from an IDE, they
normally still depend on the typical .csproj/.fsproj files created by VS.

This project will explore the possibilities of writing build scripts by hand,
in a way that is so simple that you are not intimidated by it (as oposed to
msbuild or other xml-based build tools)

One design goal is to have full support for both consuming NuGet (POC currently
working) and producing NuGet packages (not yet implemented).
